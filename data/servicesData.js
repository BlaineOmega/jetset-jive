          Our team formed because we all wanted to build an app that helped people travel. 
          When we presented our original ideas to the class, all our ideas were based on travel. 
          We got together and decided to build an application based on our own ideas. 
          This allowed us to all work on something we were passionate about within the group project.

          Most photographers love to shoot the unusual, and you don’t get much
          more unusual than These Unprecedented Times. Right now everything
          counts as out of the ordinary. There are a number of remarkable things
          about these lockdown days that are worth photographing now so we can
          remember them when it is all over.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trick here is to look slowly, and then look again. Take the time
          to look in detail and to look at the same thing from different angles,
          with different light, long lenses and wide lenses. Then move to the
          left a bit. You may never feel the need to leave the house again.
