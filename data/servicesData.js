          Our team formed because we all wanted to build an app that helped people travel. 
          When we presented our original ideas to the class, all our ideas were based on travel. 
          We got together and decided to build an application based on our own ideas. 
          This allowed us to all work on something we were passionate about within the group project.

          These are some of our sketches. This was where we brainstormed some basic ideas for our app. We created a large number of sketches and narrowed it down to the designs we liked. These sketches would eventually be modified throughout the process to fit the userâ€™s needs.

          One of the key features we focused on was the outfit planning for our travel app. Below is a sketch of the outfit planning screen:

        <p>
          This feature allows users to view suggested outfits for each day of their trip based on their itinerary and weather forecasts. Users can confirm the suggested outfit or edit it to better match their preferences. Once confirmed, the outfit is added to the packing list, ensuring that users have everything they need for their trip.

          This is the step where we had some more detailed versions of our app. We have all the different pages laid out with the general text inputs, button sizes, and the overall structure of each page. We kept things simple with using mainly different shades of black and white so that we could focus on the shape and appearance of different pages of our app.

          This is a map of the different pages in our app. We have a login in the upper right where users would set up their preferences and then we have a flow for each major section of our app which are deciding flights, hotels, restaurants, outfits, and a profile page.

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Welcome and Login:</strong> Users start with a welcome screen, proceed to login, and set up their preferences including user info, dining preferences, travel preferences, fashion preferences, and credit preferences.</li>
          <li><strong>Home:</strong> This is the main dashboard with navigation to all major sections of the app.</li>
          <li><strong>Flight Search:</strong> Users can search for flights by selecting the date, time, and location, choosing departing and returning flights, reviewing flight details, and completing the payment.</li>
          <li><strong>Hotel Booking:</strong> Users can search for hotels, view hotel information, and book their stay.</li>
          <li><strong>Dining Home:</strong> Users can search for restaurants, view restaurant details, and filter options by distance, cost, and rating.</li>
          <li><strong>E-closet Management:</strong> This includes managing outfits for trips, viewing planned outfits, and editing outfits. Users can upload images, take pictures, and manage their outfit lists.</li>
          <li><strong>My Account:</strong> Users can manage their travel, dining, and fashion preferences from their account settings.</li>

         These are the hi-fi prototypes of our app's flight booking feature that we created to get a clearer picture of what our app will look like and how it will function. 
         From the sketches, we can see that the flight search page has not evolved much compared to the flight review page where we added more necessary details that would be informative to our users. 
         The flight results page has been separated into two, one for departing flights and another for returning flights. When we were doing the paper prototype, 
         we realized that we needed to account for both the departing and returning flights and this was simply not a task we could accomplish with just one search result page. 
         It is also important to note that across the app, we have changed our navigation bar at the bottom of the screen to allow users to switch between the services offered in our app.
