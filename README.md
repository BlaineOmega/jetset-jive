This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Set your local env to run a next project. This one uses Yarn https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

All of the processes will be in the Service page. To update the section go to the services data under /data/servicesdata.js. That is the static content for the services we will be using.
